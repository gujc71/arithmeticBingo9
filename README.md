# Arithmetic Bingo Game

This is a bingo game developed to help children learn basic arithmetic operations easily. The game runs on mobile phones.

The beginner steps of multiplication were mostly written through conversations with ChatGPT (see chatGPT.html), which I refined and implemented at the end.

I have optimized this code to create an actual arithmetic bingo game that a child can play, and I plan to add more features whenever possible.

The game consists of the following:

### 1. Addition Bingo Game
- The game is designed as an addition bingo game with single-digit (A1), two-digit (A2), and three-digit (A3) numbers.

### 2. Subtraction Bingo Game
- The game is designed as an subtraction bingo game with single-digit (A1), two-digit (A2), and three-digit (A3) numbers.

### 3. Multiplication Bingo Game
- Biginner: Bingo games for multiplication tables from 2 to 9 are played step by step.
- Middle: Bingo games for multiplication tables from 2 to 9 are played with all numbers presented randomly. The grid size can be selected as 3*3, 4*4, or 5*5..
- Advanced: Same as the middle level, but success requires all directions of bingos to be correct.

### 4. Division Bingo Game
- The game is conducted in the same way as the multiplication problem, but the player needs to input the divided values.
